# sass-code-test

In thid repo, I'm using Sass (it's a css preprocessor) ,it has some cool concepts & features that can make you able to do a lot of things that you might not be doing in native css
like (variables, imports, mixins, parameters, calculations, etc...) just to make myself ready to work on real projects and start learning react
